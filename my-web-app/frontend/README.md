# My Web App Frontend

This is the frontend part of the My Web App project. It is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it interacts with the backend to generate plots based on user input.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the web application.
- `scripts/app.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for handling user interactions and making API calls to the backend.
- `styles/style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the frontend application.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-web-app/frontend
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the application.

## Usage

- The application allows users to input code for generating plots.
- The frontend sends the code to the backend, which processes it and returns the generated plot as an image.

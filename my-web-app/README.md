# My Web App

This project is a web application that consists of a Python backend and a JavaScript frontend. The backend is built using Flask and is responsible for handling requests and generating plots based on user-provided code. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Install the required Python packages using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the backend application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application.

## Usage

- The frontend allows users to input code for generating plots.
- The backend processes the request and returns the generated plot as an image.

## Deployment

This application can be deployed on Render using the provided `.render.yaml` configuration file. Follow the Render documentation for detailed deployment instructions.
